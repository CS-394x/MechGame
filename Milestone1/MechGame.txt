Mech Game Idea: Jacob Macdonald & Rafael De Los Santos <Howl Interactive, Inc.>

There are many great games available for iOS, among the most popular being “infinite runners” like Flappy Bird and Temple Run. Infinite runners are fun because they are quick, hard, and can be played in full in ones downtime on the subway or in line at a restaurant. On the other end of the spectrum there are games like Infinity Blade and Clash of Clans: equally fun, but more complex experiences that require the user to learn a complicated control scheme and allocate a larger chunk of time. 

From our experience playing phone games, there aren’t too many games that combine the two experiences, not properly at least. Our goal is to create game that incorporotes the simple, one-touch controls of an infinite runner with the intellectual challenge and atmosphere of a more complex phone game. 

Our game will consist of a protagonist, a robot or mech traversing a scrolling, randomly generated city. Enemy mechs will spawn off screen and enter the city via roads. The player’s goal is to stay alive as long as possible. 

Both movement and combat will be done through a simple one touch system. Touching a passive area of the screen (such as a road) will set a “move-target” and move the player in that direction. Touching a destructible object (such as a building or an enemy) will not effect movement (the player will still move towards the move-target) but will point the player towards that object and begin attacking (via weapons like lasers and missiles). The player will continue auto-fire until the target is destroyed. This way, the user can still plan out an attack plan without worrying about firing each individual bullet.
